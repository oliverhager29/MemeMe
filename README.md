# MemeMe
IOS application for creating Meme.
A Meme consists of an image (taken with the camera or selected from the photo album) and a top/bottom text. This Meme can be shared (share image action). The shared Memes are saved and can be viewed in a collection/table view, can be deleted and edit. New Memes can be added.
